### Introduction

Jira is a tool that helps teams manage projects using Agile methodology. It supports Agile practices and integrates with GitHub for better collaboration and project tracking. This article explains how Jira works with Agile and GitHub, and why startups should use it.

## Jira and Agile Basics

Agile is about breaking work into small, manageable pieces. Jira helps with this through:

### Epics and Goals

An **epic** is a big goal, like "build a new feature." It’s broken into smaller steps to achieve the goal, making work easier to manage.

### Stories and Tasks

Epics are split into **stories** (what the user needs) and **tasks** (steps to do it). For example:

* Story: "I want to log in safely."
    
* Task: "Add a password check."
    

This helps teams know exactly what to do.

### Story Points

**Story points** measure how hard and long a story takes. Jira uses numbers like 1, 2, 3, 5, 8:

* 1-3: Easy.
    
* 5-8: Medium.
    
* 13: Hard and time-taking.
    

This helps plan work better.

### Backlog

The **backlog** is a list of all tasks and stories. Teams pick what to work on next from here, keeping everything organized.

## Why Startups Should Use Jira

Startups benefit from Jira because:

* **Affordable and Scalable:** Jira offers plans that fit small budgets and can grow with the company.
    
* **Keeps Teams Aligned:** With small teams wearing many hats, Jira’s clear structure (epics, tasks, backlog) ensures everyone knows their role.
    
* **Saves Time:** Startups move fast—Jira’s simple workflows and GitHub integration reduce manual updates and keep projects on track.
    
* **Improves Focus:** Story points help startups prioritize what matters most, avoiding wasted effort on low-impact tasks.
    

## Collaboration in Jira

Jira helps teams work together by:

* Showing task updates.
    
* Letting team members comment and talk.
    
* Tracking task status (like "To Do" or "Done").
    

## GitHub Integration

Jira works with GitHub to connect coding to tasks:

* Developers link code commits to Jira tasks (e.g., "Fixes TASK-123").
    
* Jira shows these updates, like commits or pull requests.
    
* This helps track everything from planning to coding, making sure nothing is missed.
