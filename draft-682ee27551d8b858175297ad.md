### “**Containerd**” is working on background for docker

officially is an part of CNCF

How docker used Containerd?

by using docker deamon (backgroud process) is responsible to manage docker

different build tools like

maven → java

pip → python

npm → node

based on that we need to create docker file and to rescarch for version

any application you want to run is having an operating system

OVERVIEW OF DOCKERFILE

```dockerfile
#1) base image (os)
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

#2)working dir for the app
WORKFDIR /app

#3)copy the code from your host to container(work dir)
COPY src/Main.java  /app/Main.java

COPY quotes.txt quotes.txt

#4)run the commands to install libs or to compile code
RUN javac Main.java 

#5)expose port 
expose 8000

#6)Serve the app /keep it running 
CMD ["java","Main"]
```

CMD → u can override afterwords

ENTRYPOINT → can’t change

```powershell
docker build -t java-quotes:latest .

docker images

docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name java-quotes-app java-quotes:latest 


docker container prune
#to delete all stop cotainer 
```
